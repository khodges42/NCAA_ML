## NCAA Bracket Predictions

### Thank Yous
Big thanks to Julia Elliot for the starter notebook, as well as Kasper P. Lauritzen for last year's starter notebook.
Thanks to Google and NCAA for the datasets, and Kaggle for being Kaggle.
### Notebooks
March 11 - Spent some time formatting how I wanted the data to be organized. I am right now training the predictor to learn both to predict on seed difference, as well as attempt to get some recognition of team strength.

March 11 - 2 - Tweaked the loss function a bit to get a better prediction, and modified the predictor to reflect the changes to the training dataset.
